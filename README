Beamer style for IIST 
===================== 

This is an attempt to learn how to create styles in LaTeX rather 
than creating documents using existing styles. To make the theme 
simple, we make use of only two lines, two squares and the default 
LaTeX font for the entire document. The style is defined in 
'beamerthemeiist.sty'. We added proper comments in the definition 
script so that you can also customize the theme, if you want. Hope 
you enjoy the theme.

Note: There is no compulsion to use this theme. If you don't like it, 
please delete it for ever from your system. You can use 'Shift + Del' 
key so that it will removed, even from your Recyle bin/Trash.  


How to use the theme
--------------------

* As the first step, extract the zip file. You can have a file named 
  'pres.tex' as the source, that you need to compile using your 
  LaTeX software. I added some of the basic LaTeX constructs to get 
  familiarize with the theme. You can replace the content in 
  'pres.tex' with your own content.

* The file 'pres.bib' is for bibliography. You can put all the bibtex 
  entries in 'pres.bib'. 

* Please don't delete IIST logo ('logo.pdf') from the folder. 

* For those who are familiar with Linux command line, I created a 
  'Makefile' to make the compile process simple. Running the 'make' 
  command will compile and generate the pdf. The command 'make 
  clean' will delete all the unwanted files created during the 
  compile process.


Prerequisites for the theme
---------------------------

For GNU/Linux
--------------

* Make sure that the following packages are installed. If not, 
  install them using the following command (For Ubuntu/Debian systems)

  $ sudo apt-get install latexmk texlive-fonts-recommended \
    texlive-latex-extra texlive-bibtex-extra biber
    
For Windows
-----------

* Make sure that the packages such as bibtex, biber etc. are 
  properly installed. It is recommended to install the complete 
  LaTeX package.

If you have any comments OR if you find any errors with the code, 
please send me a mail with the error report (if possible along with 
the .tex file). 
Note: Errors are preferred to comments.

Thank you.
